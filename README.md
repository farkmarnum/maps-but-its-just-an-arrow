maps, but just a arrow

## wat

Have you ever used Google Maps / Apple Maps / Mapquest / Bing-me-there (idk) and thought:

> This is too complicated! All these complicated squiggly lines and colors... all I need is an arrow telling me which way to go!

Wait, really? You did?
Well... uh, I guess this app is going to be really great for you. I made it as a joke, but it sounds like you're really into this sort of thing.

## how

This app leverages the Places and Directions APIs from Google to get (walking) navigation routes once users provide a destination and give location permissions. Then the app provides the user with a compass arrow, always pointing the direction they'd eed to walk to follow the directions. The backend does the heavy lifting, and all API queries are requested from the backend.
